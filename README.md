# Engine Simulator

This project was originally created by [AngeTheGreat](https://github.com/ange-yaghi). 

The purpose of this fork is to introduce beginner users to the project and include more engine options to choose from.

## What is it?

This is a real-time internal combustion engine simulation **designed specifically to produce engine audio and simulate engine response characteristics.** It is NOT a scientific tool and cannot be expected to provide accurate figures for the purposes of engineering or engine tuning.

## How do I install it?

Click [here](https://github.com/TheReywob/engine-sim/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download the ZIP folder.

Once you download and extract the ZIP folder, you will find a file called *how_to_start_simulator.txt*. This will help you setup and run the simulator for the first time.

## How do I use it?

The UI is extremely minimalistic and there are only a few controls used to interact with the engine:

| Key/Input | Action |
| :---: | :---: |
| A | Toggle ignition |
| S | Hold for starter |
| D | Enable dyno |
| H | Enable RPM hold (see below for instructions) |
| G + Scroll | Change hold speed |
| F | Enter fullscreen mode |
| I | Display dyno stats in the information panel |
| Shift | Clutch (hold spacebar to slowly engage/disengage) |
| Up Arrow | Up Gear | 
| Down Arrow | Down Gear | 
| Z + Scroll | Volume |
| X + Scroll | Convolution Level |
| C + Scroll | High frequency gain |
| V + Scroll | Low frequency noise |
| B + Scroll | High frequency noise |
| N + Scroll | Simulation frequency |
| M | Increase View Layer |
| , | Decrease View Layer |
| Escape | Exit the program |
| Q, W, E, R | Change throttle position |
| Space + Scroll | Fine throttle adjustment |
| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Simulation time warp |
| Tab | Change screen |

### Using the RPM hold
The RPM hold feature will hold the engine at a specific RPM and also measure the engine's horsepower and torque at that RPM. You can enable RPM hold by pressing the `H` key. **You must then enable the dynomometer** (press the `D` key) in order for the RPM hold to take effect. To change the hold speed, hold the `G` key and scroll with the mouse wheel. The RPM hold will be shown on the `DYNO. SPEED` gauge in the lower left of the screen.
